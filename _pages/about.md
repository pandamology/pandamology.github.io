I am a Lecturer in Arithmetic Geometry at [Hainan Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hainan-biuh.edu.cn/en/homepage/) (BiUH).

My research interests include arithmetic geometry and analytic number theory, with a focus on explicit and concrete problems arising in arithmetic contexts.

I am particularly interested in situations where geometric, analytic, and arithmetic ideas interact, and where abstract structures admit explicit formulations and computations. Some of my work involves explicit computation and occasional implementation to support theoretical results.

I received my Ph.D. under the supervision of [David Holmes](https://davidholmes.nl/) and [Robin de Jong](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jongrsde/) from [Mathematical Institute](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics) at [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). My earlier training at the master’s level was under the supervision of [Jianya Liu](http://www.prime.sdu.edu.cn/info/1023/1151.htm) from [School of Mathematics](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/).
