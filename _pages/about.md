I am an Assistant Professor in Arithmetic Geometry at BiUH.

My research interests include arithmetic geometry and analytic number theory, with a focus on explicit and concrete problems arising in arithmetic contexts.

I am particularly interested in situations where geometric, analytic, and arithmetic ideas interact, and where abstract structures admit explicit formulations and computations.
