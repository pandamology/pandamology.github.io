I am an Assistant Professor in Arithmetic Geometry at BiUH.

My research interests include arithmetic geometry and analytic number theory, with a focus on explicit and concrete problems arising in arithmetic contexts.

I am particularly interested in situations where geometric, analytic, and arithmetic ideas interact, and where abstract structures admit explicit formulations and computations. Some of my work involves explicit computation and occasional implementation to support theoretical results.

I received my Ph.D. under the supervision of [David Holmes](https://davidholmes.nl/) and [Robin de Jong](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~jongrsde/).  
My earlier training at the master’s level was under the supervision of [Jianya Liu](http://www.prime.sdu.edu.cn/info/1023/1151.htm).
